# The Site

This site is dedicated to sabermetric analysis of things that are impressively good, impressively bad, or just notably strange within Japan's NPB. I will be writing up articles to share my findings and my progress as I learn more about data analysis, R, and Japanese baseball, and I hope you enjoy the ride.

All data sourced from DeltaGraphs' [https://1point02.jp](https://1point02.jp) and [Baseball Reference](www.baseball-reference.com) unless stated otherwise.
