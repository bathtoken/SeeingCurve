>I should probably just admit right now that during the time it took me to finish this article Norimoto threw a one-hit complete game shutout against the ORIX Buffaloes, recording 9 Ks in the process. So, umm… Maybe we found him? (All stats were amended to include this game).

Pacific League baseball tears on into May and, as the dust settles, so too do the standings. Seibu have maintained a great start to the season despite some expected mild cooling off, and the Fighters and Hawks look poised to make the pennant race an interesting one for the rest of the year. If there’s one team that has struggled out of the gate, though, it’s Rakuten.

Sorry, Pippin. Not this year.    
What exactly is ailing the Eagles? I'm not going to delve into that in any detail here, but for my money, a team wRC+ of 74 contributing to an NPB-worst 101 runs is abysmal enough to be a large part of the reason on its own. Aside from that, the pitching hasn’t been _terrible_. Definitely bad, but there have been some glimmers of hope. In fact, veteran RHP Takayuki Kishi looks to be having another great year since being traded from the Lions, pitching his way to a 1.60 ERA with some decent peripherals to follow it up. Right now though, I’m not interested in what’s going wrong with the offence, or what’s going right for Kishi. I care about what’s currently going on with Tohoku ace Takahiro Norimoto. Why do I care more about Norimoto’s season so far than that other stuff? Who knows, the mind wanders. Largely, though, it’s because this year’s Norimoto looks a little different, and his 2017 form was just crazy to watch.  

Few starting pitchers, if any, were as dominant as Takahiro Norimoto in 2017. The 5’10 right-hander fanned a league leading 222 batters in 185.2 innings for a 10.8 K/9. While he was nothing more than a dark horse for the Sawamura Award due to the great perfomances from Sugano (Giants) and Kikuchi (Lions) in more traditional metrics, no one was sitting them down quite like Norimoto. All those strikeouts led to some really impressive, league-leading numbers:
