>I should probably just admit right now that during the time it took me to finish this article Norimoto threw a one-hit complete game shutout against the ORIX Buffaloes, recording 9 Ks in the process. So, umm… Maybe we found him? (All stats were amended to include this game).

Pacific League baseball tears on into May and, as the dust settles, so too do the standings. Seibu have maintained a great start to the season despite some expected mild cooling off, and the Fighters and Hawks look poised to make the pennant race an interesting one for the rest of the year. If there’s one team that has struggled out of the gate, though, it’s Rakuten.

What exactly is ailing the Eagles? I'm not going to delve into that in any detail here, but for my money, a team wRC+ of 75 contributing to an NPB-worst 101 runs is abysmal enough to be a large part of the reason on its own. Aside from that, the pitching hasn’t been _terrible_. Definitely bad, but there have been some glimmers of hope. In fact, veteran RHP Takayuki Kishi looks to be having another great year since being traded from the Lions, pitching his way to a 1.60 ERA with some decent peripherals to follow it up. Right now though, I’m not interested in what’s going wrong with the offence, or what’s going right for Kishi. I care about what’s currently going on with Tohoku ace Takahiro Norimoto. Why do I care more about Norimoto’s season so far than that other stuff? Who knows, the mind wanders. Largely, though, it’s because this year’s Norimoto looks a little different, and his 2017 form was just crazy to watch.  

Few starting pitchers, if any, were as dominant as Takahiro Norimoto in 2017. The 5’10 right-hander fanned a league leading 222 batters in 185.2 innings for a 10.8 K/9. While he was nothing more than a dark horse for the Sawamura Award due to the great perfomances from Sugano (Giants) and Kikuchi (Lions) in more traditional metrics, no one was sitting them down quite like Norimoto. All those strikeouts led to some really impressive, league-leading numbers:

As shown, Norimoto's powerful, strikeout-heavy approach paid dividends last year as he was, by a not-inconsiderable amount, the most valuable man on the mound with the fielding-independent stats to match.  

The Eagles ace's 2018 season is telling a different story so far. While by no means disastrous, Norimoto's season thus far has left a lot to be desired. After his most recent outing, a 9 IP, 1 H, 9K CGSO definite glimpse of 2017 Norimoto, he had the following to say:
>"I threw terribly in my last two games, so I wanted to get the team a win with my pitching this time” ([Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2018/05/12/baseball/japanese-baseball/eagles-ace-takahiro-norimoto-hurls-one-hit-shutout/))  

So what exactly has been different in those last two games that would lead to the strikeout king of the Pacific League pitching, as he put it, "terribly"? Including his latest true-to-form masterpiece start Norimoto is sporting a 23.3 K% (29.6% in 2017), his lowest since his 2013 rookie campaign, and he's missing bats at a career-worst 11.4% rate (14.2% in 2017). So that's the result, but what's the cause? I had a look at the struggling RHP's pitch type percentages going back as far as his 2014 season (this is as far as that kind of data goes) and noticed something kind of strange. Norimoto's using his fastball nearly 9% less than in 2017, which, as a guy capable of topping out at 158kmph/98.2 mph with great spin rate and coming off a career year, seems like a weird change to make.

That's a gif of a Norimoto 2017 heater, just for fun, and here's two charts. The first shows Norimoto's pitch type percentages from 2014-2018, which gives us a vague idea of the trends. The second is the one I'm personally more interested in, as it shows the stark change from 2017 to 2018 in a clearer way:

<br>

One thing is abundantly clear: Norimoto hasn't eased up on the heater in favour of any one pitch in particular, but has simply just been throwing everything else a little more. The righty's splitter is seeing a 3.2% increase relative to the season total thus far, the slider is seeing a little more action too in lieu of the fastball. I have a hunch that this doesn't say a whole lot about Norimoto's troubles, because in addition to that great four seamer his slider and split-finger are both excellent pitches. What concerns me a little is the changeup. The difference between 2016 and 2017 Norimoto's pitch selection seems to be a move away from the changeup in favour of the curve and the excellent splitter, and 2018 Norimoto's giving that changeup the time of day again (4.4% -> 7.2%). A minor detail, but there's slightly less of a difference between the average velocity of his changeup and fastball than last year, which may be
relevant given that we're seeing that off-speed pitch slightly more and the heater notably less.  

More than anything right now, I wish I had access to some Brooks-baseball-esque zone and pitch type data for NPB games. As it stands, I have a theory that Norimoto's slow start is at least partially the result of (a somewhat league-wide trend of) giving the heater a break and instead favouring his breaking and off-speed pitches in certain counts/situations. Disappointingly, I don't think my search has managed to uncover where 2017 Norimoto has gone. That said, I expect we'll see him soon.
